## Project Title
This is the first project I have worked on through git hub. This project is titled Hello World as a memento to it being my first project on my git hub profile page. 

## Description
This project is the first project I have done through the git hub platform. I am aiming to work on my skills of using git hub and progressing with the platform as a whole. This project is designed to showcase some of the basic skills that I have learned in recent times. I hope to be able to look back on this project as the first milestone of my achievements as I continue down the BAIS path. 

## Files Used
For this project I did not use any files but I have this space here as a reference to what could be used on future projects. I would insert the file names as well as their origin and what is contained within the data files. 

## Tools Used
For this project the only tool I used was the **github markdown cheat sheet**. For future projects I would include any other tools that I used whilst working on the project.  This tool assisted me in creating all the markdown syntax needed. [github markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/im-luka/markdown-cheatsheet?tab=readme-ov-file#links) 

## How To Run Program
For this section I would explain how to run the program and what files would need to be available. 

## Additional Information
For this project I have not attached any additional information but I included this section as a reference for future projects. This section would contain any additional, written information about the project that would be helpful to know for anyone viewing it.
